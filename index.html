        <h2>His early Life</h2>
        </div>
            <p>LeBron James started out in life extraordinarily well! His successful basketball career began in kindergarden. He won the world championship for the Little Tikes Basketball League!</p>
        <p>Moving on to elementary school, he progressed quickly. As a ten year old, he was already renowned for his shooting, driving, and dunking on full-sized hoops. He carried his school all the way to elementary division one, and succeeded in taking the trophy for the Medium Tikes one-on-one basketball tournament.</p>
        <p>Young LeBron James' talent really began to show itself in Middleschool. He was able to dunk over his principle, who was six feet, ten inches tall. The Middleschool basketball team he played for was able to beat any highschool team in the country. 
        <p>
        His career spiked dramatically in high school. At St. Mary High, the media began to portray him as a future NBA super star, which he turned out to be. 
        </p>
        LeBron James never went to college. It was his first and biggest mistake in life. Other than knowing a bunch of sweet basketball moves, he is now an ignorant bum.
