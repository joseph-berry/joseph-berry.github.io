<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<h2>Tom Butler Introduced </h2>


<p>
One day, Tom woke up and yawned. “Phew,” said he. He was relieved; he didn’t have good sleep. Tom, was 6’1” and lived in a cabin by himself in a country called Maserea. He spoke English, and was a white guy. Tom also had a sword. He had not gotten good sleep that last night. He got up, got ready for the day, then he got a pan. He then took a pack of bacon and cooked it for breakfast. While he ate breakfast, he thought whether he should hunt afterward or what he should do. He decided he’d rather not hunt because he didn’t want to kill off a species of animals. If he killed off one after one type of animal, then those animals would all be gone with none left. In these days dinosaurs are really rare since most people shot ‘em down. But, to say it is very probable that there could be one or about two more of ‘em that we haven’t seen yet. I would not say that it is impossible, but as I said there might be one out there somewhere anyway. He had only eaten two pieces of bacon when he had felt very hungry for dessert. But, he decided he would have one or two more pieces of bacon before he hammered down a cake for his dessert to control his emotions. After eating one-fourth of his cake, he wanted to eat more but his stomach was full. To say, he actually felt like eating two cakes. Tom had about nine blackberry cakes, but at this rate he could only eat one-fourth of that. Then, the very next moment he cleaned up and took a nap. While he slept, he was snoring so loud that that made him even sneeze. He dreamed that his door broke down and about sixty-nine timberwolves came running in at him. He was trapped so he jumped down a hole into a dungeon, but they followed him and scratched him up. Then, he climbed up out of the dungeon and out his door. Then, he climbed up a tree and he was safe since wolves cannot climb trees. But, they waited and waited and waited but he refused to come down. Finally, they left him and he went inside his cabin with a broken door, broken hinges unable to repair. Sigh, sigh, sigh, sigh Tom just woke up. “I have never dreamed something like that, it’s scary and ridiculous,” said Tom. “I’d better have something to eat for lunch, it is eleven twenty-five already,” Tom said. Tom then hard boiled 3 eggs for his lunch. During lunch, he had his dream popped still in his mind he could not stop thinking of it. He was thinking of how miserable it would be if that was something that happened in his real life. He wished it not to happen in his real life since wolves are dangerous. He was not gonna hunt really huge game after lunch. But, he thought it would not hurt to catch some fish since they are not major species to kill off all the time. So, after he ate his lunch he took a fishing net and a basket and went out to the lake. But, apparently the first time that he threw his net in the water he caught seven fish at a time. Then, he put ‘em in his basket. He put his net in the water again. This time, he caught twenty-two. Then, he put them in his basket and went inside his cabin. That night, Tom turned out all his lights except his porch light. Then, Tom lit a fire and roasted some marshmallows to eat. After his tenth marshmallow, Tom Butler read to himself a story called No One Really Can Tell How Awesome Heaven Will Really Be. When Tom was done reading the book he shut it and took a prayer to God. He asked God to help him to tell what the message of the book actually meant. Tom was a believer in God and he never wanted to stop that. Then, he ate his eleventh marshmallow and all the ones he had. Then, he got in his bed and fell asleep for the night. In the morning, for breakfast he cooked some meatloaf. He thought again of catching fish, anyway he thought it would not hurt to catch at least ten more. After he was finished with cooking his meatloaf, he put the meatloaf on a plate and got a fork and knife. The knife was for cutting the meatloaf in little squares. Then, the fork was for eating the meatloaf. What you do is you cut the meatloaf first, then second you use the fork to eat it. Tom then took the knife, and cut up his meatloaf. Then, Tom took his fork and started to eat. This meatloaf was so delicious to him that he could not stop eating.
Once he ate all his meatloaf, he felt like having more but he was really actually ready for a blackberry cake. So he got up, and took out a blackberry cake from the cellar.
He thought it would be the best to start out with eating one slice of cake.
After eating one slice of blackberry cake, he took a second slice of cake.
Finally after eating half of his blackberry cake, Tom Butler’s stomach was full and he could eat no more. After that, he went outside to catch some fish. He swung his net into the ocean. Tom was amazed. It was a barracuda this time. Tom took the barracuda inside his cabin. Then, Tom cut up the barracuda and put it in his fridge inside a bag. Later that day, Tom cooked some of the barracuda meat for lunch. He only ate a little bit of it though since that barracuda was a big one. The barracuda he caught was six feet long and four feet wide. Tom wasn’t going to catch anymore fish after lunch. You can guess, he’s gonna take a rest. Once Tom was done cooking the fish, he turned off the stove. Then, he prayed a blessing to God before he began his lunch. This was his blessing to God before he began to eat lunch: 
“Dear LORD thank you for my food, thank you I have this cabin to live in for now, thank you for this country, and I pray I would never stop trusting in you amen.” And that was Tom’s blessing to God. Then, Tom took a plate from the cupboard; After that, he got a fork and knife. Then, Tom took his plate and put fish meat on it. After that, Tom cut up his fish with his knife and began to eat. This barracuda meat was so good and delicious. Tom could not believe how good this meat was. This was way better than the meatloaf he ate for breakfast. When Tom’s main meal was ended he decided to have some dessert. This time, he decided to have either watermelon or pineapple. “I’ll have watermelon,” said Tom to himself. So, Tom took a watermelon from the cellar and put it on his table. Then, Tom took a nice sized cutting board and put it on the table. After that, Tom got a serrated knife and put it on the table. Then, Tom sat down and began to cut the watermelon. After he was done cutting up the watermelon, he began eating it. After he had eaten one-fourth of the watermelon, he decided to freeze the other three-fourths of it. After Tom’s lunch, he went and changed into his swim trunks. Then, he went out to the ocean with goggles and a towel and began to swim. He left his towel on the shore for when he came back. He went out, as far as possible as he could. He went down deep, deep in the ocean. He got to see jellyfish, a shark, a blue whale which are not too common, and a seahorse. When he got back to the shore, he dried himself off. After that, he went in his cabin; then, he took a shower, because the ocean is not the cleanest place to be in. After his shower, he turned on his TV and watched the news. It was telling the weather for the next few days; Tom saw, that it was supposed to rain the next day which was Saturday. The news guy said that it would maybe not rain all day, but rain like from 8:00 am. - 2:00 pm. Tom, was happy that it was not gonna rain all day long at least. After an hour of watching the news or sports, Tom turned off his TV and took a nap. Tom had a dream that his cabin door began to crack from bottom to top; but, the crack didn’t fully go all the way to the other side. When Tom woke up, he was glad that that wasn’t real. It was now six-thirty pm. So, because of the time Tom decided it was time for dinner. For dinner, Tom cooked some steak. Before Tom ate dinner, he prayed a blessing to God. These are the words that Tom spoke: 
“Dear LORD, thanks for this food, I pray I’d keep being a believer and never end that, I also pray that you would bless this food to my body, and I pray that the rest of my day would continue to go well in your name amen.” Those were Tom’s words. Then, Tom sat down at his table with a fork, knife and plate. After that, Tom took the knife and cut up his steak with it. Then, Tom began eating his steak. He thought of catching fish afterward, but he decided to control his emotions about that. After Tom’s main meal, he decided to have some blackberry cake for dessert. First, he got his cake from the cellar. Then, Tom cut a big decent sized slice for him to eat. After Tom ate two-fourths of his cake, he put it away. Then, Tom got a pack of 40 marshmallows. After that, Tom got the book No One Really Can Tell How Awesome Heaven Will Really Be. Then, Tom tu

rned out all his lights except his porch light which you know of course. After that, Tom lit a fire and read the book; After an hour of reading the book, Tom shut it and made a prayer to God. 
These are the words Tom said:
“Dear LORD, thank you for this book and I pray I’d understand it.” Then Tom began to roast some marshmallows and eat them. After that, Tom got in his bed and fell asleep for the night. In the morning, Tom woke up and got ready for the day. Then, Tom took his grill outside and began to cook some sausages. When Tom was done cooking his sausages, he got some buns. Then, he took a sausage and put it in one of his buns. Before Tom ate he prayed to God. This is what Tom said.
“Dear LORD, thank you for this food and I pray that you’d bless the rest of my day in your name amen.” Those were Tom’s words. Then, Tom began eating. It was Saturday, but it wasn’t raining yet since it was only 7:30. Once Tom was done having his main meal, he cut up some pineapple for his dessert. When Tom began eating the pineapple, he realized that it was so good; After Tom ate half of the pineapple, he freezed the rest of it. Later that day while it was raining, Tom was sleeping. Tom thought he was having a dream, but it was a vision from God. Tom found himself in the woods walking on a path. Then, from behind he heard a rumbling noise. Out of nowhere, over his head a weird creature jumped over Tom. This creature was a type of wolf/grizzly animal that is called a BOK. Tom had just ducked in time to not die. Then, The BOK jumped at Tom, but Tom cut it with his sword. After that, the BOK came for Tom again and jumped at him. But, Tom ducked and the BOK flew over him. Then, once again the BOK tried to kill Tom but he sliced it open. Hu, hu, hu, hu, hu, hu, hu, hu Tom just woke up. “That is the most scary dream I ever had.” Then, Tom prayed to God and asked what he saw. These are the words Tom said.
“Dear LORD, what have I seen and will this happen later in my life.” Tom could hear God telling him what he saw. Then, Tom heard God say to him, 
“THIS WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE, 
ALSO THAT WAS A VISION NOT A DREAM.” Then, Tom saw that the time was 3:13 pm. So, Tom decided it was lunch time. For lunch, Tom took a pan. Then, Tom poured some oil in the pan and put some rice in it too. Then, Tom fried the rice for a nice straight fifteen minutes. After Tom fried the rice, he turned off the burner. Then, Tom got a spoon, a fork, and a plate. Then, Tom prayed and began to eat. After Tom’s main meal, he got out some frozen watermelon from the freezer. Then, Tom began to eat some watermelon. This watermelon frozen was so good; after eating one-fifteenth of the bag, Tom put the bag away and turned on the TV again. He began to watch the news again. The news guy said it was gonna be nice and sunny and Tom was happy about that. After watching two to three hours of the news, Tom turned off the TV and decided to have some dinner.
